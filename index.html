				<h2>3DS Particle Demo</h2>

				</div></div>
				<p>
					A simple particle demo for the Nintendo 3DS written in C.
					I wrote it to test out multithreading on the 3DS.
					Includes controls to edit the particles size, color, position, etc.
					It was written to target *.3ds homebrew to use with a Gateway 3DS cartridge back in the day.
					So the code will need some tweaking to compile with the latest version of ctrulib and homebrew launcher.

				<h2>3DS Chip8-CTRU</h2>
				<img src="img/chip8-ctru.jpg"/>
				<p>
					A port of a Chip8 emulator for the Nintendo 3DS written in C.
					Includes multi-rom support.
					Also played around with adding stereoscopic 3D effects only using software rendering.
					This too was written for Gateway *.3ds files so the code needs to updated to work with the latest version of the libraries.

				<h2>OpenRegion 3DS</h2>
				<img src="img/openregion.jpg" style="max-width: 420"/>
				<p>
					OpenRegion is an ROP payload that takes advantage of a bug in certain versions of the 3DS System Setting.
					It allows users to bypass region lock and run game cartridges from other regions on their 3DS.
					Payloads are available for 3DS firmware version 4.X and 6.X.

				<h2>Neon GBA Lighting</h2>

				</div></div>
				<p>
					Neon GBA is a per-tile lighting engine for the Gameboy Advance. 
					It uses precomputed look-up tables to grab the correct color tile 
					based on how "brightly" lit the tile is by different colored light sources.

				<h2>Mergepal</h2>
				<img src="img/mergepal.jpg"/>
				<p>
					A command line utility written in C++.
					It's used to merge the palettes of multiple 256 color BMP files.
					It outputs the merged palette and the raw data for each BMP using the new palette.
					I made this because I needed to create a common sprite palette while keeping each individual sprite's data in separate files for GBA/NDS development.

				<h2>Transconsciousness - MiniLD #55</h2>
				<div id="outer"><div id="inner">
				<iframe width="420" height="244" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLi7HU0GfNg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div></div>
				<p>
					This a game I made back in highschool for MiniLD #55, a game development challenge. 
					The theme was preparation. 
					So the player "prepares" what moves the character will make at the beginning of the level.
					After each action is planned, markers are displayed to show where enemies will be after that action occurs 
					(based on how long the actions takes and how fast the enemy moves).

				<h2>Tetris Puzzle Challenge</h2>
				<img src="img/tetrispuzzle.jpg"/>
				<p>
					A simple Tetris clone made with Lua and the Love2D game engine. 
					Also includes puzzle levels where the blocks that fall are pre-determined
					and the player must use them to clear the entire level.

				<h2>Hololens Development</h2>
				<img src="img/hololensdemo.jpg"/>
				<p>
					I've developed a proprietary Hololens application for a start up 
					that probably wouldn't appreciate if gave their ideas away on the internet 
					while they still in the early stages. <br/>
					To put it in generic terms, it app collected data from each of the user's sessions
					and stored it in a database.
					Included floating GUIs that followed the user's gaze, login, gesture and voice commands, and all that fancy stuff.
